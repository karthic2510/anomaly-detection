# Readme File 

This git folder contains the projects in anomaly detection (Fraud analysis) I have completed over the past year.

I started out with R, but overtime as the data became larger and the models ran for longer I shifted to Python. 

Since python doesn't use RAM for the entire dataset, I was able to run more complex models on larger datasets.

The folder contains analyses in the following industries:

1. Healthcare Insurance fraud: Exploratory Data Analysis, outlier detection using PCA, KNN, AutoEncoder and Isolation Forests.
2. Mortgauge loan defaults: EDA, outlier detection using h2o (GLM, GBM, RF, Neural Networks)
3. Credit Card Transaction Analysis: EDA
4. Stock investment analysis: EDA, algorithmic models exploration (basic)

I used the following packages:

1. R:
	* ggplot2
	* plotly
	* gridExtra 
	* DT
	* dplyr
	* caret
2. Python:
	* pandas
	* numpy
	* seaborn
	* matplotlib
	* pyOD
	* h2o
